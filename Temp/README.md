# Analysis_Tools
A subset of the tools that are a part of the Analyze_Metadata module that
can be used for analysis of csv files generated by metadata.py <br />

## Overview of Current Tools

__The following tools all attempt to curate and parse an input
string into a standardized format. The nuances of each module are
highlighted below__ <br />

### collection_date.py
Curates and parses dates. Returns the curated date (if it exists),
an error value, and the original date if it fails to parse. <br />

### geographic_location.py
Curates and parses various geographic locations. Returns the curated
location (if it exists), and the original date if it fails to parse. This
module uses various standardized lists in the directory "/Resources/" to
standardize provinces, countries, and acronyms. <br />

### serovar.py
Curates and parses serovars. Returns the curated serovar as well as
type-specific data such as variant. Like with geographic_location, this
module uses a standardized list in the directory "/Resources/". But if the
serovar fails to match against this list, a suggestion will be generated by
the spellcheck module. <br />

### isolation_source.py (in progress)
Like serovar.py above <br />

The remaining modules in this directory (open_geo_files.py,
open_iso_src_files.py, and open_serovar_lookup.py) are helper
functions used to open and parse the standardized files for each
respective module.
