To achieve successful and nearly ‘real-time’ monitoring and identification of outbreaks reliable sub-typing is essential. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) shows great promises for use as a routine epidemiological typing tool. Here we evaluate WGS for typing of S. Typhimurium including different approaches for analyzing and comparing the data. An epidemiologically well-defined collection of 34 S. Typhimurium isolates was sequenced. This consisted of 18 isolates from six well-defined outbreaks and 16 epidemiologically unrelated background strains. In addition, 8 S. Enteritidis and 5 S. Derby were also sequenced and used for comparison. A number of different bioinformatic approaches were applied on the data; including pan-genome tree, k-mer tree, nucleotide difference tree and SNP tree. The outcome of each approach was evaluated in relation to the expected epidemiological relationship among the strains. The pan-genome tree clustered 65% of the S. Typhimurium isolates according to the pre-defined epidemiology, the k-mer tree 77%, the nucleotide difference tree 100% and the SNP tree 100% of the strains within S. Typhimurium. The resulting outcome of the four phylogenetic analysis were also compared to PFGE reveling that WGS typing achieved the greater performance than the traditional method. In conclusion, for S. Typhimurium, SNP analysis and nucleotide difference approach of WGS data seem to be the superior methods for epidemiological typing compared to other phylogenetic analytic approaches that may be used on WGS data. These approaches were also superior to the more classical typing methods such as PFGE. Our study also indicates that WGS alone is insufficient to determine whether strains are related or un-related to outbreaks. This still requires the combination of epidemiological data with and whole genome sequencing results.",PRJEB1954,PRJEB1954,ERP002633,Evaluation of whole genome sequencing for epidemiological typing of Salmonella enterica,Evaluation of whole genome sequencing for epidemiological typing of Salmonella enterica,"Styph-000419417, ena-EXPERIMENT-DTU-16-05-2013-10:59:07:477-1, Evaluation of whole genome sequencing for epidemiological typing of Salmonella enterica",28901
